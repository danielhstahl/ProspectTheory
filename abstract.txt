In this paper, I prove the existence of an expectation representation of preferences without requiring the independence assumption of von Nuemann and Morgenstern's theorem.  I show that a measure exists such that preferences which violate the independence axiom can still be represented by an expectation.  This parsimonious extension of Expected Utility Theory addresses a major objection from behavioral economics and enables the vast literature that is based on Expected Utility Theory to remain on solid theoretical footing.  I demonstrate this technique by showing that an expectation representation exists that resolves the Allais Paradox.
